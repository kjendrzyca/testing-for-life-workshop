# testing-for-life-workshop

The goal of this workshop is to familiarize yourself with testing, tests structure, assertions, maybe some r# and visual studio.

Todo:

1. Test `Add` method
    - make sure it works for different cases (positive and negative numbers...)

2. Test `Divide` method
    - make sure it works for different cases (positive and negative numbers...)
    - make sure it prevents dividing by zero

3. Change `Add` method to accept a list of numbers

4. Test `LookAtMyAbs` method

5. Throw `YouShouldNotCheatOnYourExamsException` in every method when you use the calculator between 8:00AM and 8:45AM
